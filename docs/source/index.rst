In recent years, there has been a rising frequency of emerging viral infections, such as SARS, Zika, and the more recent Coronavirus 2019-nCoV outbreak. With over 320,000 mammalian viruses in existence, diagnostics efforts are critical for identifying the specific strain of the virus, designing effective diagnostic tests, and monitoring the evolution of the virus over time. One way to achieve this is using sequence data, which involves analysing the genetic code of the virus to identify specific markers or mutations. With advances in sequencing technology, it has become easier and faster to generate large amounts of sequence data, making it possible to rapidly identify and track viral strains. This approach is essential for controlling the spread of viral diseases and developing effective treatments and vaccines.
